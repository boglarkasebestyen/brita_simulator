# Brita Simulator 

### A Brita simulator written in SwiftUI ![](https://static.gosquared.com/images/software/logo_integ_swift_01.png)

This is my first SwiftUI app. After following along a tutorial, instead of finishing off the course with a similar app that was already covered in the course, I became inspired to write one that simulates a Brita, or any other water pitcher.

###How it works

* By default, the pitcher is full, showing the water percentage at 100%.
* **"Pour water"** button: the water will decrease by both percentage and on the graphic image.
* **"Fill tank"** button: fills the tank with water; water increases by both percentage and on the graphic image.
* **Special features:** 
 1. At a random time interval, an alert warns the user to change the filter. The water turns brown until the filter is changed with the help of the **"Change filter"** button. The water percentage is reset to zero, the user must fill the tank again with water.
 2. Bonus sound effects accommpanying the buttons.
